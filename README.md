## NOT WORKING YET [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bahmutov/cypress-angular-unit-test.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bahmutov/cypress-angular-unit-test)

If you run `$(npm bin)/cypress open` and click on "spec.ts" it does not show any errors, meaning a component has been bootstrapped. Not the HTML looks very weird and nothing is running. I assume the Angular code is running in the spec iframe and cannot cross into the app iframe where the component has been mounted.

See [cypress/integration/spec.ts](cypress/integration/spec.ts) for mounting code.

## Working

I have successfully used this mounting approach to test components in other frameworks.
